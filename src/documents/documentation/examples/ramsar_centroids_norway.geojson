While the Northern and Western parts are covered with lakes and small ponds, covering 10% of the area of the island, the South and East are dominated by tall mountain formations partly with steep cliffs. High primary production makes this site an important foraging area. 126 different species of birds have been observed on the island, of which 33 breed here, including species listed on the Norwegian (Svalbard) Red List such as Common Guillemot Uria aalge (VU) and Razorbill Alca torda (EN). The seabird colonies in the southern parts of Bjørnøya are among the largest in the Northern Hemisphere. It is estimated that over one million seabirds gather here during the breeding season. The site fulfills the 1% criterion for Black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla with approx. 125,000 breeding pairs. It is also an important resting and foraging site for migrating birds such as Pink-footed geese Anser branchyrhynchus, Barnacle geese Branta leucopsis and Brent geese Branta bernicla hrota. The marine area surrounding Bjørnøya is important as nursery ground for e.g. cod, haddock and Greenland halibut. In total there are 24 fish species and most of the Arctic whale and seal species have been observed.

Nature Reserves. An extension of 18 wetlands units to the existing 4, expanding the 1985 Ramsar site from 400 to 3,256 ha. The system lies in an agriculture-dominated area of southwestern Norway with formerly extensive wetlands - coastal sites remain largely intact, but freshwater sites have been drained on a large scale. Marine areas are dominated by sand, mud, pebble, and stone shores, with large areas of dune systems. Freshwater areas are characterized by shallow water and extensive stands of Phragmites communis, and three smaller mire systems have also been included in the site. The newly-extended site is said to be incomparably the single most important area for wetland-related birds in Norway, especially as a staging and wintering area. Given strong agriculture influences and high levels of nitrogen pollution in the area, the importance of the remaining wetlands in the lowland is extraordinarily high in terms of their function as sediment traps and in water purification. Along the shorelines one can find the densest collection of archaeological sites in Norway, with grave mounds dating back a thousand years or more. Action plans to decrease agricultural runoff are showing promise, and buffer zones are being contemplated. Tourism (walking, sunbathing, birdwatching) is fairly heavy in the area.

Human activities have included drainage for agricultural purposes, but strict regulations prevent construction, hunting, and drainage today. The site is presently used for fishing, bird-watching, sheep grazing and small-scale seaweed cutting and has some value in shoreline stabilization. The creation of a wetland information centre is planned. Ramsar site no. 310.

Sklinna is a small archipelago which consists of several islets and some small islands with rock and stone dominated shores, divided by shallow water. The main island in the archipelago is Heimøya. The archipelago as a whole is an important site for seabirds, especially in early summer when the bird numbers amount to 20-25,000 individuals. The most numerous bird species are Atlantic Puffin Fratercula arctica (3,500 pairs) (VU), European Shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis (3,200 pairs; 1% criterion) and Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo (1,100 pairs; 1% criterion). Furthermore, it is a breeding area for nationally red-listed bird species such as Common Guillemot Uria aalge (CR) and Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (EN) as well as for wintering seabirds. The site is regularly visited by the Grey Seal Halichoerus grypus and the Common Seal Phoca vitulina. Less frequently the False Killer Whale Pseudorca crassidens and the Otter Lutra lutra (VU) come to this Ramsar Site. In terms of flora, Red Campion Silene dioica is one of the most common species. However, in gull and cormorant colonies the droppings offer nitrous substrate which benefits plants such as Common Scurvy Weed Cochlearia officinalis and Common Sorrel Rumex acetosa. Sklinna has a long history of traditional fishing.

The site includes shallow and nutrient rich sea areas, islands, numerous ponds and lakes, streams, small rivers and further inland ice covered mountain ridges. It is characterised by permafrost and erosion from wind, ice and the sea and mainly covered by spotted grass vegetation. Svalbard Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus muta hyperborea is the only bird species wintering on land. A few bird species like Long-tailed Duck Clangula hyemalis and gulls and auks might occasionally overwinter in areas free of sea ice, but most bird species are migratory. Waders, goose species and seabirds are the dominant groups. Some of these breeding species are listed on the Norwegian (and Svalbard) Red List including Red Knot Calidris canutus (EN) and Sanderling Calidris alba (VU). 19 species of marine mammals can be observed in the area, including Svalbard Reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus and Arctic Fox Vulpes lagopus, and Polar Bear Ursus maritimus. Permafrost areas and mires represent important carbon reservoirs.

The Tana is one of the largest rivers in Norway and the most important for wild salmon Salmo salar. The mouth of the river has created a shallow estuary, partly brackish, and huge underwater deposits of gravel. Some sandy islands are situated in the middle of the site. An unspoilt river estuary of this size is rare in Europe. The site is particularly important for Goosander Mergus merganser, with 21,000 individuals registered in October 2010. The River Tana plays a significant role in flood protection and sediment transport and is extremely important for the local Sami culture, both as a traditional means of transport and as a source of salmon. Possible threats to the site include the introduction of invasive species through the unloading of ballast water, potential oil spills and plans for the development of a new quarry on the western side of the site.

Nature Reserves, Animal Protected Areas. An archipelago of several larger islands and numerous islets in shallow marine waters. The landscape has a mosaic pattern including rocky shores, narrow mires/bogs, and sparse vegetation influenced by seabird guano. Some of the islands are covered by a nationally endangered heathland mosaic with bogs and ponds. The large mires constitute important water reservoirs during dry periods and play an important role for flood control during periods of heavy precipitation. The wetland supports breeding, staging and wintering populations of many nationally threatened species such as Black Guillemot Cepphus grylle, Atlantic Puffin Fratercula arctica, and Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla. The islets hold populations of Grey Seal Halichoerus grypus and Harbour Seal Phoca vitulina. More rarely, False Killer Whale Pseudorca crassidens, and Eurasian Otter Lutra lutra visit the archipelago. European Roe Deer Capreolus capreolus is common on some of the islands.
